java workspace emacs shit:
  -remove the project root with lsp-workspace-remove
  -cd to .emacs.d/.local/etc/java-workspace/ and remove whatever leftover project folder cache is laying there
  then go back to emacs and open the project again. it'll ask if you want to import the project root. say i and it should work.
